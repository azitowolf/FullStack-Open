# U Helsinki Fullstack Open Coursework

## Organization + Filestructure

Every part (parts 0-9) has at least one repo, with the prefix "FSO-..." attached to the beginning.
Each application that is used across multiple parts (ex. the phonebook application) will be copied.

## All Parts
### part0
In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the practicalities of taking the course. After that we will have an overview of the basics of web development, and also talk about the advances in web application development during the last few decades.

Response repo: FSO-part0 https://github.com/azitowolf/FSO-part0

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

### part2
Let's continue our introduction to React. First, we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.

### part3

In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.
